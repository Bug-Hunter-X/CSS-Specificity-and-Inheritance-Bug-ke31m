To reliably override the styles, you need to use more specific selectors or the `!important` flag (though this is generally discouraged).  Here are a couple of ways to solve the issue:

**Method 1: More Specific Selectors**

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

div span p {
  color: green; /* Now this rule is very specific and overrides both */
}
```

This approach modifies the `div p` selector to be `div span p`, making it specific enough to always override the `div` and `p` rules regardless of nesting.  

**Method 2: Using `!important` (Less Recommended)**

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

div p {
  color: green !important; /* Force this rule to be applied */
}
```

Using the `!important` flag overrides all other rules. This is less preferable because it can make CSS harder to maintain and debug, but it directly tackles the inheritance issue.
