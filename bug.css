The following CSS code snippet exhibits an uncommon error related to specificity and inheritance:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

div p {
  color: green; /* This rule should override both the div and p selectors */
}
```

The issue arises when you expect the `div p` selector to override both the `div` and `p` selectors due to its higher specificity.  However, the browser might render the text in green *only if* the `div p` element is a direct child of the `div` element.  If the `p` element is nested deeper within the `div`, for example:

```html
<div>
  <span>
    <p>This text might unexpectedly be red.</p>
  </span>
</div>
```

The `p` selector with `color: red` will override `color: green` due to specificity rules which favor more precise selectors.
